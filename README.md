# javascript_clock
<h1>A digital clock made using javascript</h1>

<p>This small project was originally created with the hopes of trying it out in one or all of the following languages:
AngularJS, Angular 5 and/or Vue.js.  Starting with Javascript(which I know) and creating something that I can then use to help learn new frameworks and languages has become a very good learning tool for me.  Since this has become a great method of learning for me I'm going to start committing more of these practices here on Github.</p>
